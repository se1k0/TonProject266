- `withdrawal_payout` - `slice | null` - address of deployed withdrawal payout of current round (`null` if not deployed)
- `requested_for_withdrawal` - `int` - amount of pool jettons requested for postponed (till the end of the round) deposit in this round
- `sudoer` - `slice | addr_none` - address of sudoer role (`addr_none` by default)
- `sudoer_set_at` - `int` - timestamp when sudoer was set (quarantine is counted from this date)
- `governor` - `slice` - address of governor role
- `governance_update_after` - `int` - timestamp after which governor can be updated
- `interest_manager` - `slice` - address of interest manager role
- `halter` - `slice` - address of halter role
- `approver` - `slice` - address of approver role
- `controller_code` - `cell` - code of controller
- `pool_jetton_wallet_code` - `cell` - code of pool jetton wallet
- `payout_minter_code` - `cell` - code of payout
- `projected_total_balance` - `int` - amount of TON expected to be accounted by the Pool at the end of the round
- `projected_supply` - `int` - number of expected issued pool jettons at the end of the round


Current pool jetton/TON ratio is equal to `total_balance/supply`. This ratio is used for immediate withdrawals in *optimistic* mode.

Projected pool jetton/TON ratio is equal to `projected_total_balance/projected_supply`. This ratio is used for immediate deposits in *optimistic* mode.

`(slice) get_controller_address(int controller_id, slice validator)` - returns address of validator controller with given id and validator address. Note controller may be not yet deployed.

---
`(int, int) get_controller_address_legacy(int controller_id, int wc, int addr_hash)` - the same as previous but accepts parsed validator address and return parsed controller address

---
`(int, int) get_loan(int controller_id, slice validator_address, int prev?)` - return loan body and load interest for given controller

---
`(int, int) get_controller_loan_position(int controller_addr_hash, int prev?)` - We order all loans by controller address hash, put them in line and find position of median of given controller loan. This data can be used for deterministic voting: if stakers decide to vote in some proptions, we can check that controllers voted in the same proportion. Returns numerator and denominator.

# Controller
